=== Personal solution description ===

1. Decompile beleaf with Ghidra
2. Find main function
3. Clean up variable names
4. Find the two global pointers that are iterated through like an int array and long array respectively
5. Redefine them their bytes as arrays of type int and long respectively
6. ???
7. Profit
8. Be too lazy to write them out manually so make a beleaf_solution.c "generator" and just copy paste the hex arrays into a C array.
